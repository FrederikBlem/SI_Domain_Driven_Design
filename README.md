# Research: Domain Driven Design

### Description

## Domain Driven Design – 10 study points
Research the Internet and/or the recommended books and find the answers of the following questions:

#### ● what is DDD?
"
DDD is a software development approach that uses and builds upon OOAD () principles and ideas.
Domain in the realm of software engineering commonly refers to the subject area on which the application is intended to apply. In other words, during application development, the domain is the “sphere of knowledge and activity around which the application logic revolves.”

Personal note: DDD seems to be concerned with translating the real world business logic into application logic.
"

DDD focuses on three core principles:

    Focus on the core domain and domain logic.
    Base complex designs on models of the domain.
    Constantly collaborate with domain experts, in order to improve the application model and resolve any emerging domain-related issues.

Evans’ Domain-Driven Design further defines a few common terms that are useful when describing and discussing DDD practices:

    Context:
    The setting in which a word or statement appears that determines its meaning. Statements about a model can only be understood in a context.
    Model:
    A system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain and can be used to solve problems related to that domain.
    Ubiquitous Language:
    A language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software.
    Bounded Context:
    A description of a boundary (typically a subsystem, or the work of a specific team) within which a particular model is defined and applicable.

#### ● when did it originate?
"Initially introduced and made popular by programmer Eric Evans in his 2004 book, Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software"

#### ● which problems did it address?

    Eases Communication: 
    Simple and agreed upon terms will make it easier to communicate about non-simple terms and logic.
    Improves Flexibility: 
    DDD is flexible because of the advantages that being based upon Object-Oriented analysis and Design. 
    Emphasizes Domain Over Interface:
    With the focus being on the domain (the actual business logic and subject area) rather than the interface, it will also translate to usefulness in aggregating value     for the business as long as the UI/UX doesn't directly detract from that.

#### ● which are the basic concepts and building blocks of a domain model

#### ● how does DDD relate to microservices architecture?


This is an individual task.
